## üìñ About

This repository houses my NixOS Linux configuration, featuring the Hyprland window manager and adorned with the stylish Catppuccin Macchiato theme. I rely on this setup as my daily driver for work and programming, primarily in Rust ü¶Ä. Feel free to utilize it in its entirety or borrow specific components for your own configuration.

üö®It's essential to note that this configuration is not minimalistic or lightweight and may require some disk space and knowledge to understand. If you're looking for something simpler, this configuration may not be suitable for you.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ **Reproducible**: Built on NixOS, this configuration can be effortlessly reproduced on other machines, ensuring a consistent setup.

- üñåÔ∏è **Consistent**: Nearly every component has been meticulously styled to adhere to the Catppuccin Macchiato theme, providing a visually cohesive experience.

- ‚úÖ **Complete**: This system is equipped with a wide range of components and utilities, akin to the completeness of operating systems like MacOS or Windows.

- üé® **Customizable**: Leveraging the power of Linux and Hyprland, this configuration offers extensive customization options, allowing you to tailor your setup to your preferences.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Download and Install NixOS from the [official site](https://nixos.org/download).
2. Temporarily install ripgrep and fish using the command: `nix-shell -p ripgrep fish --run fish`. You can also use classic bash and grep for the next step without installing fish and ripgrep.
3. Run the command `rg --hidden FIXME` and change/add lines to match your device, swaps, partitions, and file systems in the configuration files (`/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` & `/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix`).
4. To change the default username and/or hostname, run the command `rg --hidden 'xnm'` to find and fix all instances of the username, and `rg --hidden 'isitreal-laptop'` for the hostname. Make sure to change the username to match yours to avoid login issues.
5. Copy all files (with replacements) from the `home` directory to your `$HOME` directory in Linux.
6. Copy all files (with replacements) from the `nixos` directory to `/etc/nixos/`. It's recommended not to copy and replace `hardware-configuration.nix`; only copy it if you have already change it for your hardware.
7. Run the command `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`. After this, you will have a complete system. You can also use flakes after first setup by running `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake /etc/nixos` if needed.

## ü¶Ä Useful info for Rustaceans

Here are some tips to enhance your Rust experience on this system:

1. **Installation Customization:**
   This system utilizes [rust-overlay](https://github.com/oxalica/rust-overlay) for Rust installation using the Nix approach. To customize the installation, including modifications to compilation targets, components, channels, or profiles, follow these steps:

   - Locate the `/nixos/rust-toolchain.toml` file and make the necessary adjustments based on your requirements.

   - If you are working on multiple projects with distinct `rust-toolchain.toml` files or need to switch between stable and nightly Rust versions, consider the following options:
   
     - Set up a Nix environment using `flake.nix` and [rust-overlay](https://github.com/oxalica/rust-overlay) for each project separately. Utilize `nix develop` to manage project-specific Rust environments.

     - Alternatively, you can install `rustup` through `configuration.nix` and nixpkgs for a system-wide Rust setup. This allows you to manage Rust versions globally through `rustup`.

2. **Troubleshooting Compilation Issues:**
   If you encounter problems during Rust compilation, especially those related to OpenSSL or SQLite (refer [here](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Rust#Building_Rust_crates_that_require_external_system_libraries)), leverage the `rustenv` fish function. This function is an alias for the `nix-shell -p pkg-config openssl sqlite --run fish` command, opening a Nix shell with the necessary dependencies for seamless code compilation. Additionally, if you use Nix shell, compilation will occur in the runtime directory, which might be insufficient for some projects. You can adjust the runtime directory size in `configuration.nix` under `services.logind.extraConfig="RuntimeDirectorySize=4G"`.

3. **Cross-Compilation:**
   For cross-compilation, consider using tools like `zigbuild` or `cross`. Personally, I find `zigbuild` preferable, but both are valuable options for your cross-compilation needs.

4. **Cargo and Rust Tools:**
   This system comes equipped with a variety of cargo and rust tools to ensure a smooth Rust development experience. Some of these tools include:
   - `rust-analyzer`
   - `cargo-deny`
   - `cargo-audit`
   - `cargo-update`
   - `cargo-edit`
   - `cargo-outdated`
   - `cargo-license`
   - `cargo-tarpaulin`
   - `cargo-cross`
   - `cargo-zigbuild`
   - `cargo-nextest`
   - `cargo-spellcheck`
   - `cargo-modules`
   - `cargo-bloat`
   - `bacon`

5. **Environment Setup:**
   You can set up your Rust project environment on this system using `nix develop` or `nix-shell` with `default.nix`, `shell.nix`, or `flake.nix` to create a tailored environment for your Rust project.
